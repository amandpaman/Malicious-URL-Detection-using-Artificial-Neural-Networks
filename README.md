# Malicious-URL-Detection-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks
A machine learning solution for identifying and classifying malicious URLs using artificial neural networks. This project aims to enhance cybersecurity by automatically detecting URLs that may pose security risks.
Key Features:

URL Preprocessing:

Develop a module for preprocessing URLs, extracting relevant features, and transforming them into a format suitable for machine learning.
ANN Model:

Implement an artificial neural network architecture for training and classification. Experiment with different architectures, such as feedforward neural networks or recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
Dataset:

Include a dataset of labeled URLs, comprising both malicious and benign examples. You may use public datasets or create your own labeled dataset.
Training Script:

Provide scripts for training the neural network on the dataset. Include hyperparameter tuning and optimization steps.
Evaluation Metrics:

Implement evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Web Interface:

Create a simple web interface to demonstrate how the model can be used for real-time URL classification. Users can input a URL, and the model provides predictions.
Deployment:

Explore deployment options, such as hosting the model on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) or creating a REST API for integration into other applications.
